"versions":
  - '1.1': |
      * added a use-cpo-save mechanism
      * stopped multiple inclusions
      * added color scheme completion
      * wrapped the auto-commands up into a auto-command group
      * allow the command to be called w/o any arguments so it would display the current colorscheme just like the :colo command does
      * shorten the command name
      * (Thanks Peter Rincker!)
